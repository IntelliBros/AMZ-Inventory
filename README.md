## Usage Guide

### 1. Add Products
- Navigate to "Products"
- Click "Add Product"

- Optionally add ASIN/FNSKU
- Enter reference costs (used as defaults)

### 2. Create Purchase Orders

- Add line items with products and quantities
- System auto-fills current product costs
- No shipping costs on PO (tracked separately)
- Save to create PO

### 3. Create Shipping Invoices
- Navigate to "Shipping"
- Click "Add Shipping Invoice"
- Link to a PO (optional)
- Enter carrier, tracking, and shipping date
- Add line items with products and quantities
- **Split shipments**: You can create multiple shipping invoices for one PO

- Enter actual shipping costs per unit or total
- Save to create shipping invoice

### 4. Track Inventory
- Navigate to "Inventory"
- Click "Add Inventory"
- Select product and location type
- Enter quantity and costs
- Costs can differ from reference costs
- Link to PO if applicable
- Shipping costs from shipping invoices

### 5. View Dashboard

- Monitor total inventory value
- Track key metrics

## Cost Calculation Logic

The system uses a batch-based costing approach:

1. **Product Current Cost**: The default/current cost for a product
2. **Inventory Batch Cost**: Each inventory batch can have its own cost (from specific PO)
3. **Unit Total Cost**: Product Cost + Shipping Cost per unit
4. **Location Value**: Sum of (Quantity Ã— Unit Total Cost) for all batches in that location
5. **Total Inventory Value**: Sum of all location values

This allows for:
- Accurate COGS tracking
- Historical cost analysis
- Different costs for different batches
- Weighted average cost calculations

## Security

- Row Level Security (RLS) enabled on all tables
- Users can only access their own data
- Secure authentication with Supabase Auth
- Environment variables for sensitive data

## Deployment

### Deploy to Vercel

1. Push your code to GitHub
2. Import project to Vercel
3. Add environment variables in Vercel dashboard
4. Deploy

### Deploy to Other Platforms

The app is a standard Next.js application and can be deployed to:
- Netlify
- Railway
- AWS Amplify
- Self-hosted with Node.js

## Future Enhancements
